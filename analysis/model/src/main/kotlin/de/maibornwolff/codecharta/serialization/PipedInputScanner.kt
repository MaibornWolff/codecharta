// Bash runs commands in a pipe chain in parallel. This means that the input may not be available/complete at the
// time of reading it.
// The ccsh commands need to determine whether there is piped input or not. If there is, it should wait until the
// input is complete. To indicate that there will be a piped project, the filters/importers of ccsh send a blank to
// their OutputStream as soon as they start. This is detected by potentially following commands and is taken as a
// sign to wait. In order to give the preceding command time to send this blank, we wait for some time before
// checking the availability of the InputStream.
