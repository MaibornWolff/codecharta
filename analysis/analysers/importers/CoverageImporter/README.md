# Coverage Importer

**Category**: Importer (takes in a coverage report generated by any coverage tool - see supported languages below)

The CoverageImporter generates visualisation data from a coverage report generated by any coverage tool. The coverage report must be in one of the supported formats (see below). The CoverageImporter generates node attributes for each file in the coverage report.

| `line_coverage`         | The percentage of lines covered by tests in the file.        |
| `branch_coverage`       | The percentage of branches covered by tests in the file.     |
| `statement_coverage`    | The percentage of statements covered by tests in the file.   |
| `instruction_coverage`  | The percentage of instructions covered by tests in the file. |
| `complexity_coverage`   | The percentage of complexity covered by tests.               |

| `<pathToReportFile>`                 | path to the coverage report file (when specifying a folder, the importer searches for a file matching the default file name - see above) |
| `-l, --language`                     | specify the language of the coverage report (see above)                                                                                  |

| `-o, --output-file=<outputFilePath>` | output File (or empty for stdout)                                                                                                        |

```
Usage: ccsh coverageimport <pathToReportFile> [--language] [-h] [-nc] [-o=<outputFile>]...
```

## Example

### JavaScript / TypeScript

1. Create a coverage report with your coverage tool, e.g. with Jest
2. Import the coverage report with the CoverageImporter

```bash
  ccsh coverageimport lcov.info --language=javascript -o typescript_coverage.cc.json
```
