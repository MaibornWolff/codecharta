# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/)

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- the file origin of a node is displayed in the details now
- added support for git log --numstat and codechurn
- sonarqube analysis on CI build

### Changed
- Deltas are no longer experimental
- two selected delta maps now merge their nodes correctly. The map where 
a node was missing get's a copy of this node with metrics=0. 
File additions/deletions are therefore only visible when areaMetric is 
unary and deltas are activated.
