## refactoring

-   refactoring of algorithm needs more work, maybe abstract the layout Generator for both street and squared layout.
-   needs more unit tests.
-   refactore horizontalStreet.ts (layoutTopRow, layoutBottomRow are very similar)

## bugs

-   height is not calculated properly.
-   manual margin is not working.

## improvement

-   scaling is not same in both algorithm.
-   no label on streets.
-   autocentering the camera does not always fit the label, the bounding box should include the labels.
