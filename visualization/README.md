## Tasks

#### Build

`npm run build` builds the project in dist/app. This artifact is ready to be served as a web application.
`npm run doc` generates the esdoc documentation in dist/doc/

#### Test

-   `npm run test` runs all unit tests on the source files in app/ and generates a coverage report in dist/coverage/.
-   `npm run e2e` runs all e2e tests on the built app in headless mode. You have to stop your running dev-webserver.
    To follow/watch the steps the e2e test is performing, deactivate headless mode in jest-puppeteer.config.js (and maybe set the slowMo parameter).

adding ":auto" to run target will run the tests in watch mode
