## Naming conventions

### Branching

Branch names consist of a type and the describing branch name itself, which is always **lowercase** separated by **dashes**.
It follows this structure `<type>/<issue-id>/<name>`.
For more detailed information check out the source [Branch Types by CKSource](https://docs.ckeditor.com/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/contributing/git-commit-message-convention.html)

| Types       | Changelog | Description                                        |
| ----------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `feature`   | yes       | New feature I add or expand                        |
| `fix`       | yes       | Bug fix                                            |
| `docs`      | yes       | Updated documentation                              |
| `revert`    | yes       | Revert of some commit                              |
| `codestyle` | no        | Our beloved code style improvements / refactorings |
| `tech`      | no        | Other kinds of technical changes                   |

Examples:

- `feature/123/add-settings-option-xyz`
- `fix/124/solve-unecpected-settings-errors`

### Commit Messages

To unify the appearance of all commit messages we only accept commit messages using the following principles:

- A commit contains the following, while the `<body-description>` is optional:

  ```
  <subject-line> #<issue-id>

  [<body-description>]
  ```

- Separate subject-line from optional body-description with a blank line
- Use the body-description to explain what, why or how within max 72 characters
- Limit the subject line to 50 characters and add the **GitHub Issue Number** with the `#`
- **Capitalize** the subject line
- Do not end the subject line with a full stop
- The subject line always uses the **imperative mood** and is able to **complete the following sentence**:
  > If applied, this commit will ...

### Pull Requests

- The PR Assignee is only used by the reviewer to see who is reviewing it
