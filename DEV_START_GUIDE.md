# Developer Quick Start Guide

---

CodeCharta consists of two separate parts:

- The [analysis](https://maibornwolff.github.io/codecharta/docs/analysis/) which is a cli-tool that generates a `.cc.json` file.
- The [visualization](https://maibornwolff.github.io/codecharta/docs/visualization/) that consumes said file and visualises it in form of a tree map. The visualization has both a desktop client and a [web version](https://maibornwolff.github.io/codecharta/visualization/app/index.html?file=codecharta.cc.json.gz&file=codecharta_analysis.cc.json.gz).

Both parts are in active development, meaning as a developer you can contribute to both. For more on how we communicate and how you can give feedback, check out [feedback](https://maibornwolff.github.io/codecharta/docs/feedback/).

All major decisions are documented in our [architecture decision records (ADR)](https://maibornwolff.github.io/codecharta/categories/#adr). Itâ€™s also important to know that CodeCharta uses [two different tech stacks](https://maibornwolff.github.io/codecharta/adr/ADR_1_decide_tech_stack/) for analysis and visualization.

# Requirements

To work on CodeCharta, please ensure your system includes:

- Git
- Java >= 11, <= 21
- Node >= 20

# Install guide

To start contributing to CodeCharta, first clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MaibornWolff/codecharta) and navigate into it

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/MaibornWolff/codecharta.git
# navigate into the created folder
cd codecharta
# install npm dependencies
npm i
```

CodeCharta consists of the two parts analysis and visualization which can be installed and used separately.
Meaning, it is not necessary to have the visualization installed when only working on the analysis part of CodeCharta and vice versa.
Therefore, this guide includes separate installation guides for both parts.

## Install Analysis

```bash
# change into analysis sub-folder
cd analysis
# build the program from source (result is bundled in .tar and .zip files)
./gradlew build
# installs the built distribution
./gradlew installDist
```

With this, the cli-tool is installed. When running `ccsh` however, we still get an error as the command is not accessible.
There are three ways in which the cli-tool can be used:

- Navigate into the folder where the installed shell and batch files are created (`analysis/build/install/codecharta-analysis/bin`) and executing commands from there
- Call the ccsh with the relative path to the current location. E.g. in the analysis folder with `./build/install/codecharta-analysis/bin/ccsh`
- Add the installed shell or batch files to the path to make it globally accessible. This can be done by adding the shell or batch file to the path of your terminal.
  As this process is specific to each terminal, we cannot include instructions here, but searching for "{name-of-console} add to path" should result in fitting instructions.
  This solution is recommended, as it is the most effort in the short term but the most comfortable in the long run.

## Install Visualisation

As the visualisation has both a desktop client and a web-version, we provide instructions on how to install both.

### Web version

This option will be the more comfortable choice for development, as the program is started as localhost and changes are quickly visible.

```bash
# change into visualisation sub-folder
cd visualization
# install visualisation specific npm dependencies
npm i
# build and start the web-version as localhost
npm run dev
# this should open a browser window with the web version
```

### Desktop client

We also provide CodeCharta as a standalone desktop app with versions for windows, mac and linux. A local version for your system can be built using the following commands:

```bash
# change into visualisation sub-folder
cd visualization
# install visualisation specific npm dependencies
npm i
# build the standalone app from source
npm run build
# start the built standalone client
npm run start
```

You can also directly build a distributable package (.zip) of the standalone client for your system.
For more information, see the 'Package' section of the [visualisation readme](https://github.com/MaibornWolff/codecharta/tree/main/visualization#package).

# Testing

The analysis and visualisation parts are tested separately with different tools. \
For the analysis, we use gradle for testing, linting and formatting. More information is available [here](https://maibornwolff.github.io/codecharta/docs/new-to-code-analysis/#testing).\
For the visualisation, we utilize Jest and puppeteer for unit- and e2e-tests. To run all unit tests, execute `npm test`. More information about e2e-tests can be found [here](https://maibornwolff.github.io/codecharta/dev-guide/e2e-testing-with-puppeteer/).

When opening a pull requests, all tests are executed automatically using GitHub-actions and a branch can only be merged if all tests are successful. However, it is highly recommended to test changes before pushing them!

# GitHub Actions

In GitHub Actions, we defined stages, which group different jobs. Inside a stage, all jobs run in parallel. There is no data persistence between stages, so we have to rebuild our application in each stage. The CI consists of the following stages:

- Testing (which runs on every push on an active PR)
- Sonar Analysis (which runs on every push on an active PR after testing to ensure code quality metrics are met)
- Deploy (run by `make_release.py`)

All workflow files can be found under `.github/workflows`

### Testing

- Runs Unit and E2E/UI-Tests
- Workflow: `test.yml`

### Sonar

- Publishes Sonar-Analysis-Results to [Sonarcloud.io](https://sonarcloud.io) and displays code-quality of the current PR
- Workflow: `test.yml`

### Deploy

- Deploys the application in a docker container to the github-pages
- Publishes the new version on npm
- Publishes a docker container on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/codecharta/codecharta-visualization)

- Workflow: `release.yml`

# Docker

For deployment and usage of the docker images, check out our documentation page [here](https://maibornwolff.github.io/codecharta/docs/docker-containers/).

# Troubleshooting

We mainly use IntelliJ for our development. The project generally works right away, but sometimes issues can occur:

- Sometimes when opening the main CodeCharta folder, the analysis part does not get detected as a module. To solve this, directly open the analysis folder.
- If you get Error `lint-staged: command not found` when trying to commit: Try to reinstall the node packages in the project. To do that, visit the root directory of the project (and the subdirectories for analysis and visualization if that still fails) and execute `npm ci`.
- Sometimes the first analysis build fails on new setup: One of our parsers depends on MetricGardener which is a multi-language parser to calculate metrics for a variety of languages. Therefore, make sure to install MetricGardener before trying to build the project. Also make sure that `metric-gardener` is available in your CLI, else npm will try to install it on the fly. You can find more information on the documentation page about the [MetricGardenerImporter](https://maibornwolff.github.io/codecharta/docs/metricgardener-importer).
- The integration tests for the analysis (`./gradlew integrationTest`) can fail due to OS specific problems:

  - On **windows** this may be caused by a missing or unknown `sh` command.
    To make it work, add the path to the Git `sh.exe` (which is normally placed here `C:\<path-to-git>\Git\bin`) to your PATH variable.
  - For **macOS**, it is necessary to install the `timeout` command (e.g. using `brew install coreutils`) to execute the integration tests.

- When working on visualization, IntelliJ does not correctly detect our test-suite. To execute tests using the build in runners,
  it is necessary to adjust the Jest-Configuration:
  - First select 'Edit...' from the 'More actions' menu next to the Runner icon
  - Inside there, select 'Edit configuration templates...' at the bottom left
  - Select 'Jest' and set 'jestUnit.config.json' as the configuration file as well as adding the Jest option '--env=jsdom'
  - After clicking apply, IntelliJ should e able to execute all visualisation tests

# Branching / Releasing

We create Pull Requests to the `main` branch after implementing a feature or fixing a bug. There is no release or development branch. We never push on `main` directly. Please take a look at our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/MaibornWolff/codecharta/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) before you start committing.
When updating your branch, we prefer using a rebase instead of merging to keep the commit history clean.

# Documentation structure

Our documentation is generally split between user docs and developer docs.
The user docs can be found in the [GitHub-pages](https://maibornwolff.github.io/codecharta/docs/quick-start-guide/),
while the developer docs can be found inside the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MaibornWolff/codecharta) in several README files.
Each relevant part of the project that requires explanation includes a README file.
If this is not the case, feel free to open an issue, so it will be added.
Additionally, for the analysis, the ccsh-command, as well as every parser includes a `-h` flag to show further information about its usages.
For more information about the CodeChart Shell and individual parsers, click [here](https://maibornwolff.github.io/codecharta/docs/ccsh/).

# Code Style

The basic code format is defined through the `.editorconfig`. If possible, the other formatting tools check out those rules.
Editors like VSC and IntelliJ Idea are able to apply those basic settings as well.

## Analysis

In the analysis our code style is applied through `gradle`:

```bash
# verify code style
./gradlew ktlintCheck
# format code style
./gradlew ktlintFormat
```

The tool _KTlint_ is added to gradle via a plugin. _KTlint_ is a linter and a formatting tool, with rules defined in the `.editorconfig`.

## Visualization

In the visualization we use two tools in combination: _Prettier_ and _EsLint_ with some plugins.

_Prettier_ uses `.editorconfig` for baseline configuration, together with the `prettier: {...}` section in our `visualization/package.json`.

_EsLint_ is configured inside `visualization/` via `.eslintrc.js`. It respects the formatting applied through _Prettier_ as defined by the last
entry in the `extends` array inside the configuration. Important is, that _EsLint_ does not format the code according to _Prettier_, _Prettier_
itself does the formating after _EsLint_ ran through. _EsLint_ is more focused on **Code Quality**, not on **Code Style**.

## Commits: Linting on Staged Files

Your code should be automatically checked and formatted for code style and quality before commiting. To ensure this works as expected run
`npm i` in the root directory and in `visualization/`. This command installs _Husky_, which is our tool for Git Hooks.
On commit the `.husky/pre-commit.sh` gets executed, which runs _Pretty-Quick_ (Prettier extension) on staged files as well as _Lint-Staged_ in
visualization. _Lint-Staged_ runs a given linter (in this case _EsLint_) on staged files, as defined inside the package.json `lint-staged: {...}`.

The analysis does not get automatically linted on commit.

## Editor Setup

> It is a good idea to check, if there are any plugin versions of ours tools available for your code editor. Those plugins usually enable a
> non-intrusive code linting on save, which can really help with code style, and avoids commits,solely focused on formatting.

### IntelliJ Idea

For analysis the code style is based on the official `Kotlin Coding Conventions`. This baseline can be set in the configuration.
