{{page.title}} is live and ready for [download](https://github.com/MaibornWolff/codecharta/releases/tag/{{page.title}}). This version brings the following:

### Added 🚀

- A new experimental feature has been added to track anonymous metadata of a currently loaded map.
  - Neither the map name nor file names will be tracked but anonymous metric values and statistics like (average, min, max).
  - The tracked data will not be sent to a server yet. Instead, it can be downloaded as a json file in the Global Settings for now.
  - It is planned to send the anonymous data to a server in the future, so that we can collect tracking data automatically.
  - ![example of new feature](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26900540/106896300-ac5f2480-66f1-11eb-8096-246d1733c0ee.png)

- Label over hovered building not shown for height Metric value of zero ([#1623](https://github.com/MaibornWolff/codecharta/issues/1623))
