### Added 🚀

- Added WebGL FXAA antialias & PixelRatio Options in order to achieve better resolution on high dpi displays(https://github.com/MaibornWolff/codecharta/pull/1551).</br></br>
  ![option dialog](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74670211/106582136-f4404900-6543-11eb-8f5b-5e1ec47457c7.png)
  There are 4 available modes :
  - **standard mode**: the pixel density is only applied to the small cube with standard browser aliasing
  - **pixel ratio without aliasing** : no antialiasing is used
  - **pixel ration with FXAA** : Nvidia FXAA antialiasing shader is used as an alisaing technique. this has better perfromance the standard browser aliasing aliasing
  - **pixel ration with MSAA** : this is the best aliasing quality, slower then FXAA.
- Added GPU Stats (only in dev mode)

### Fixed 🐞

- Unfocus now respects the focus depth ([#1099](https://github.com/MaibornWolff/codecharta/issues/1099))
- Track anonymous usage data also for older CodeCharta API versions and fix some minor bugs.
