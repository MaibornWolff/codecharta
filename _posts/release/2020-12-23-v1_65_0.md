{{page.title}} is live and ready for [download](https://github.com/MaibornWolff/codecharta/releases/tag/{{page.title}}). This version brings the following:

### Added üöÄ

-   Highlight label while hovering over building, draw a temporary label for hovered buildings that have none ([#1529](https://github.com/MaibornWolff/codecharta/issues/1529))
-   Integrated streetlayout ([#904](https://github.com/MaibornWolff/codecharta/issues/904))
    ![cc_street_ccv](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63230711/78872405-87eed900-7a49-11ea-984a-c0ef738779b9.png)
    In street layout file nodes are displayed as buildings and directories are displayed as streets. A street layout has the advantage of a more apparent directory structure and stable positioning of nodes after metric changes.
    two different Street layout are integrated : - StreetLayout : as described above. - TMStreet : a combination of street layout and squarified layout.

### Changed

-   The button to see excluded buildings is now merged into the flattened button. Excluded and flattened buildings can now be seen by opening the building with the eye slash icon ([#1543](https://github.com/MaibornWolff/codecharta/issues/1543))

### Fixed üêû

-   Height scaling not applied to buildings ([#1595](https://github.com/MaibornWolff/codecharta/issues/1595)))
-   Fixed multiple label positioning/scaling bugs
