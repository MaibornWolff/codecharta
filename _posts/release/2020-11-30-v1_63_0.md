{{page.title}} is live and ready for [download](https://github.com/MaibornWolff/codecharta/releases/tag/{{page.title}}). This version brings the following:

### Added üöÄ

-   Add the folder name onto the floor on the first 3 layers to get a better overview of the map ([#1491](https://github.com/MaibornWolff/codecharta/issues/1491))
-   UX Improvements related to labels allowing for user interaction #1404
    -   Labels can be hovered, hovering their corresponding node
    -   Selecting a label will select the corresponding node
    -   Hovering a label will remove its transparency and move towards the user:
        -   If other labels obstruct the hovered label it will move to the front
    -   Increased the transparency of other labels; this makes it easier to distinguish the hovered label
    -   Increase the amount of labels to 250.
-   Show file count of folders in Attribute-Side-Bar ([#1255](https://github.com/MaibornWolff/codecharta/issues/1255)):

### Fixed üêû

-   Buildings are flattened when delta is active #824.
-   Selected Building now stays highlighted when map is rotated #1498
