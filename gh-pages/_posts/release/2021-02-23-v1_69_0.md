{{page.title}} is live and ready for [download](https://github.com/MaibornWolff/codecharta/releases/tag/{{page.title}}). This version brings the following:

### Added üöÄ

-   Added WebGL FXAA antialias & PixelRatio Options in order to achieve better resolution on high dpi displays(https://github.com/MaibornWolff/codecharta/pull/1551).</br></br>
    ![option dialog](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74670211/106582136-f4404900-6543-11eb-8f5b-5e1ec47457c7.png)
    There are 4 available modes :
    -   **standard mode**: the pixel density is only applied to the small cube with standard browser aliasing
    -   **pixel ratio without aliasing** : no antialiasing is used
    -   **pixel ration with FXAA** : Nvidia FXAA antialiasing shader is used as an alisaing technique. this has better perfromance the standard browser aliasing aliasing
    -   **pixel ration with MSAA** : this is the best aliasing quality, slower then FXAA.
-   Added GPU Stats (only in dev mode)

### Fixed üêû

-   Unfocus now respects the focus depth ([#1099](https://github.com/MaibornWolff/codecharta/issues/1099))
-   Track anonymous usage data also for older CodeCharta API versions and fix some minor bugs.
