### Added 🚀

-   New EXPERIMENTAL SCMLogParser version
-   Improved performance around 300% when parsing CodeCharta
-   Improved memory usage
-   Fixed issue with old parser creating incorrect nodes in CodeCharta #871
-   ATTENTION: the parser is experimental, therefore some potential issues might remain, e.g. potentially an unhandled edge case when parsing node
-   To use the new parser a reversed git log is needed, as well as a git file list, refer to `ccsh scmlogparserv2 -h` for additional information

### Fixed 🐞

-   Color-Metric slider is set and activated in the map accordingly to the released sliderbutton #1319
-   Deselcting a building will instantly dehighlight the buildings which were connected through edges #890
