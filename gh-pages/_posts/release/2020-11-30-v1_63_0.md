{{page.title}} is live and ready for [download](https://github.com/MaibornWolff/codecharta/releases/tag/{{page.title}}). This version brings the following:

### Added 🚀

- Add the folder name onto the floor on the first 3 layers to get a better overview of the map ([#1491](https://github.com/MaibornWolff/codecharta/issues/1491))
- UX Improvements related to labels allowing for user interaction #1404
  - Labels can be hovered, hovering their corresponding node
  - Selecting a label will select the corresponding node
  - Hovering a label will remove its transparency and move towards the user:
    - If other labels obstruct the hovered label it will move to the front
  - Increased the transparency of other labels; this makes it easier to distinguish the hovered label
  - Increase the amount of labels to 250.
- Show file count of folders in Attribute-Side-Bar ([#1255](https://github.com/MaibornWolff/codecharta/issues/1255)):

### Fixed 🐞

- Buildings are flattened when delta is active #824.
- Selected Building now stays highlighted when map is rotated #1498
