**Category**: Filter (takes in cc.json and outputs cc.json)

Reads the specified files and merges visualisation data.

The first file with visualisation data is used as reference for the merging strategy and a base for the output. The visualisation data in the additional json files (given they have the same API version) are fitted into this reference structure according to a specific strategy. Currently, there are two main strategies:

- recursive (default): leave structure of additional files. This will also merge optional edges.
- leaf (beta): fit leaf nodes into reference structure according to their name (and tail of their path),
  either adding missing leaves (`--add-missing`) or ignoring them (default)

Both strategies will merge the unique list entries for `attributeTypes` and `blacklist`.

## Usage and Parameters

| Parameters                      | Description                              |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `FILE`                          | files to merge                           |
| `-a, --add-missing`             | enable adding missing nodes to reference |
| `-h, --help`                    | displays help and exits                  |
| `--ignore-case`                 | ignores case when checking node names    |
| `--leaf`                        | use leaf merging strategy                |
| `-nc, --not-compressed`         | save uncompressed output File            |
| `-o, --outputFile=<outputFile>` | output File (or empty for stdout)        |
| `--recursive`                   | use recursive merging strategy (default) |

```
Usage: ccsh merge [-ah] [--ignore-case] [--leaf] [-nc] [--recursive]
                  [-o=<outputFile>] FILE or FOLDER...
```

## Examples

```
ccsh merge file1.cc.json ../foo/file2.cc.json -o=test.cc.json
```

```
ccsh merge file1.cc.json ../foo/file2.cc.json -o=test.cc.json --leaf --add-missing
```

```
ccsh merge file1.cc.json ../foo/ -o=test.cc.json
```

This last example inputs the folder foo, which will result in all project files in that folder being merged with file1.cc.json.
