| 3   | Settings        | Switch between showing a **single** map, **multiple** maps or seeing the **delta** between two maps, provided you have loaded multiple maps.                                                                                                              |

| 12  | Metric Controls | Use the **metric bar** to select a metrics per building area, height and color. Click on the arrow to change metric details such as color range. If your map has the right data, you can also display edges between buildings.                            |
| 13  | Navigation      | Use the Viewcube to quickly change the camera perspective.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
