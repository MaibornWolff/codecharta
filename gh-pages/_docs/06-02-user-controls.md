| 15  | Metric Controls | Assess suspicious metric values and the risk profile of the selected map.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 16  | Metric Controls | Use the **metric bar** to select a metrics per building area, height and color. Click on the arrow to change metric details such as color range. If your map has the right data, you can also display edges between buildings and change the number of previews. |
| 17  | Navigation      | Use the Viewcube to quickly change the camera perspective or reset the view by clicking the compass icon.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 18  | Exploration     | Explore metrics for each building. Hover over the building to see its name and metric displayed in the metric bar. Click on it to view additional details. If you have imported sonar metrics, buildings can also be **double clicked** to see sonar details.    |
| 19  | Exploration     | The tallest buildings automatically gets a label. You can change that in the height metric details.                                                                                                                                                              |
