| 1   | Settings        | Load cc.json map or multiple maps (_hold shift_).                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 2   | Settings        | Save the current map with its changes to your file system.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 3   | Settings        | Switch between showing a **single** map, **multiple** maps or seeing the **delta** between two maps, provided you have loaded multiple maps.                                                                                                                     |

| 7   | Metric Controls | The **distribution bar** shows the distribution of file extensions for a metric.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 8   | Search/Filter   | Search for buildings [.gitignore style](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 9   | Search/Filter   | Hide/exclude the buildings from the search result. **Hidden** buildings are flattened in the map, **excluded** buildings are no longer visible. Useful if you have lots of vendor code in your map.                                                              |
| 10  | Search/Filter   | Switch between the treeview or see the hidden and excluded buildings. The latter menus can be used to restore these buildings again.                                                                                                                             |
| 11  | Metric Controls | Select a scenario, which changes multiple metrics at once.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 12  | Metric Controls | Use the **metric bar** to select a metrics per building area, height and color. Click on the arrow to change metric details such as color range. If your map has the right data, you can also display edges between buildings and change the number of previews. |
| 13  | Navigation      | Use the Viewcube to quickly change the camera perspective.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 14  | Exploration     | Explore metrics for each building. Hover over the building to see its name and metric displayed in the metric bar. Click on it to view additional details. If you have imported sonar metrics, buildings can also be **double clicked** to see sonar details.    |
| 15  | Exploration     | The tallest building automatically gets a label. You can change that in the height metric details.                                                                                                                                                               |
