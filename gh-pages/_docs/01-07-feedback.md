Are you using CodeCharta and want to give feedback? Or are you not using CodeCharta because we are missing your use case? Or do you want to contribute to CodeCharta? We are eager to get your feedback!

We communicate a lot using Github Issues. All enhancements and bugs are tracked using issues. We then give each other feedback by commenting on these issues. Likewise you can create bugs, feature request and the like as well. Or just a simple "thank you" issue if you like CodeCharta. :) If you want to contribute please check our developer documentation, which can be found on our [GitHub READMEs](https://github.com/MaibornWolff/codecharta).
