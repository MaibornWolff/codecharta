Are you using CodeCharta and want to give feedback? Or are you not using CodeCharta because we missed something? Or do you want to contribute to CodeCharta? We are eager to get your feedback.

We communicate a lot using Github Issues. All enhancements and bugs are tracked using issues. We then give each other feedback by commenting on these issues. Likewise you can create bugs, feature request and the like as well. Or just a simple "thank you" issue if you like CodeCharta. :) If you want to contribute please check [new to this code?]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _docs/07-01-new-to-code.md %}).

To see what we'll be working on soon (the backlog) or what we are working right now on (in progress) please click [this Zenhub link](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/codecharta-workspace-5cd16b609795a865159e7107/board) or install the Zenhub Firefox/Chrome plugin.

Some communication that is not issue-related also happens on Slack. If you are interested in joining our Slack consider creating an issue.
