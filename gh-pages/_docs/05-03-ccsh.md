The CodeCharta Shell (ccsh) is a convenient way to access the various tools. They in turn are divided into importers, filters and exporters.

- Importers take a source like Sonar and return a `.cc.json`
- Filters take a `.cc.json` and return a `.cc.json`
- Exporters take a `.cc.json` and return the target format

If you want to combine multiple metrics into one `.cc.json` you should get comfortable with the [merge mapper](#merge-filter). Some importers support direct pipe-through, which means you don't have to use the merge mapper. If these importers are missing a metric, please take a look at [Custom Metrics and Importer]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _docs/05-04-custom-metrics.md %}).

For further documentation considering the tools used in CodeCharta, please read the analysing-tools section.

### Parser Suggestions

When launching CodeCharta Shell without any arguments and options, CodeCharta automatically tries to suggest useful (applicable?) parsers to the user.
To do this, a resource has to be entered which can be a path to a file or folder or an url.
CodeCharta then automatically checks all parsers which support this feature and offers the user to select from a list of all parsers which have been identified as applicable.

After choosing the parsers, a dry run to configure each parser is started using the Interactive Shell.
When all parsers are configured, the user can either manually run the parsers by executing the command output by the Interactive Shell or run them together automatically.
If the latter option is selected, all configured parsers are run in parallel.

If every parser is run successfully, the shell offers the user to merge the result files.
To do that, each parsers result `cc.json` has to be moved into the same folder.

Currently, the following parsers are considered when checking for recommendations:

- GitLogParser
- SVNLogParser
- SonarImporter
- MetricGardenerImporter
- SourceCodeParser
- RawTextParser

### Interactive Shell

The interactive shell aims to aid users when executing parsers by collecting all needed options and arguments for the corresponding parser.
You can launch the interactive shell by calling `ccsh -i` or `ccsh --interactive`.
There you are asked which parser you want to run and receive questions helping you configure that parser.

Alternatively, you can directly run the interactive dialog for a parser by calling it without arguments, e.g. `ccsh sonarimport`.

In the end, the full command to launch the parser in the configured way is output for future use.

### Piped input for filters

Instead of providing a cc.json file as input, a project can also be piped to the filter:

```
cat demo.cc.json | ccsh modify -p=2
```

This behaviour is currently supported by `ccsh modify`, `ccsh merge` and `ccsh edgefilter`
