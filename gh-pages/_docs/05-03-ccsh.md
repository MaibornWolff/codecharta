The CodeCharta Shell (ccsh) is a convenient way to access the various tools. They in turn are divided into importers, filters and exporters.

-   Importers take a source like Sonar and return a `.cc.json`
-   Filters take a `.cc.json` and return a `.cc.json`
-   Exporters take a `.cc.json` and return the target format

If you want to combine multiple metrics into one `.cc.json` you should get comfortable with the [merge mapper](#merge). Some importers support direct pipe-through, which means you don't have to use the merge mapper. If these importers are missing a metric, please take a look at [Custom Metrics and Importer]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _docs/05-04-custom-metrics.md %}).

For further documentation considering the tooles used in CodeCharta, please read the analysing-tools section.

# Filters

## Edge

Generates visualisation data from a cc.json file with edges data.
For every node its edge-attributes get aggregated and inserted as node-attribute.
After using this command the file can also be visualized inside the visualization, because the `edgefilter` creates nodes,
if they did not exist before.

### Usage

`ccsh edgefilter edges.cc.json -o visual_edges.cc.json`

## Merge

Reads the specified files, merges visualisation data and prints to stdout.

### Usage

> `ccsh merge <reference json file> <json files>`
> or
> `ccsh merge <folder>`

The first file with visualisation data is used as reference for the merging strategy.
The visualisation data in the additional
json files, given they have the same API version, are fitted into this reference structure according to a
specific strategy. Currently there are two main strategies:

-   recursive (`--recursive`) (default): leave structure of additional files. This will also merge optional edges.
-   leaf (`--leaf`) (beta): fit leaf nodes into reference structure according to their name (and tail of their path),
    either adding missing leaves (`--add-missing`) or ignoring them (default)

If files with different project names shoud be merged, a new project name must be specified with -p.

Both strategies will merge the unique list entries for `attributeTypes` and `blacklist`. When invoked with `-h` or `--help` MergeFilter prints its usage.

### Examples

> `ccsh merge file1.cc.json ../foo/file2.cc.json -o=test.cc.json`

> `ccsh merge file1.cc.json ../foo/file2.cc.json -o=test.cc.json --leaf --add-missing`

> `ccsh merge file1.cc.json ../foo/ -o=test.cc.json` (Merges all project files in foo with the reference file)

## Structure Modifier

The Structure Modifier is used to modify the structure of .cc.json files. It enables to:

-   remove nodes from a project. The resulting project will not include these nodes and their children.
-   declare a node as root. This means that the chosen node will become the root node of the resulting sub-project.
-   move nodes within the project. All children of the source node will be transferred to the destination node.
-   print the hierarchy of the project.

The edges and blacklist entries associated with moved/removed nodes will be altered as well, while all attribute types will be copied.

### Usage

```
ccsh modify [-h] [-f=<moveFrom>] [-o=<outputFile>]
            [-p=<printLevels>] [-s=<setRoot>] [-t=<moveTo>]
            [-r=<remove>...]... [FILE]
```

### Parameters

```
      [FILE]                        input project file
  -f, --move-from=<moveFrom>        move nodes in project folder...
  -h, --help                        displays this help and exits
  -o, --output-file=<outputFile>    output File (or empty for stdout)
  -p, --print-levels=<printLevels>  show first x layers of project hierarchy
  -r, --remove=<remove>...          node(s) to be removed
  -s, --set-root=<setRoot>          path within project to be extracted
  -t, --move-to=<moveTo>            ... move nodes to destination folder
```

### Examples

> sh ccsh modify foo.cc.json -p=2

> sh ccsh modify foo.cc.json --remove=/root/foo --remove=/root/bar/

> sh ccsh modify foo.cc.json --move-from=/root/foo --move-to=/root/bar -output-file=project.cc.json

> sh ccsh modify foo.cc.json --set-root=/root/foo/

### Piped input

Instead of providing a cc.json file as input, a project can also be piped to the filter:

```
cat demo.cc.json | sh ccsh modify -p=2
```

# Exporters

## CSV Export

Generates CSV file with header from visualization data

### Usage

_Conventions for csv output:_

-   Every node with attributes contributes one line
-   Column named _path_ contains the hierarchical data of the node, separated via _/_
-   Column named _name_ contains the name of the node
-   Column named _type_ contains the type of the node
-   Columns named _Dir0_, _Dir1_, ... contain the splitted hierarchical data of the node for convenience
-   The other columns contain the atttributes of the nodes

### Example

> ccsh csvexport visual.cc.json

Further usage information may be retrieved through

> ccsh csvexport -h
