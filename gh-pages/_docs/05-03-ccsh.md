The CodeCharta Shell (ccsh) is a convenient way to access the various tools. They in turn are divided into importers, filters and exporters.

-   Importers take a source like Sonar and return a `.cc.json`
-   Filters take a `.cc.json` and return a `.cc.json`
-   Exporters take a `.cc.json` and return the target format

If you want to combine multiple metrics into one `.cc.json` you should get comfortable with the [merge mapper](#merge). Some importers support direct pipe-through, which means you don't have to use the merge mapper. If these importers are missing a metric, please take a look at [Custom Metrics and Importer]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _docs/05-04-custom-metrics.md %}).

For further documentation considering the tooles used in CodeCharta, please read the analysing-tools section.
