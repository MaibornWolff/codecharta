title: "Risk profile"

The Risk Profile gives a quick overview about the complexity and risk structure of the code base. It tells you how much
of the code is placed in files associated with low/high risk in means of maintainability.

The separation of code in risk classes like low or high complexity is based on Java reference metric values and therefore
may be inaccurate for other programming languages.

The Risk profile button appears in the main menu. Pressing this button will open the risk profile panel.
Here you will find listed the code percentages separated by their complexity.
