Welcome to the user documentation of CodeCharta!

This page will give you an overview over all major aspects of the programs documentation.
As CodeCharta essentially consists of two projects (analysis and visualisation), parts of the documentation are also split between them.

> _Note: This documentation explains how to **use** CodeCharta. If you want to **develop** on it, our developer documentation can be found in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MaibornWolff/codecharta)._

# How to use CodeCharta

If you are completely new to CodeCharta, please read the [Quick-Start Guide]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _docs/01-01-quick-start-guide.md %}),

If you want to install CodeCharta, you will find a guide on how it can be installed locally [here]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _docs/01-03-installation.md %}).
We also provide docker containers for both parts of CodeCharta. Documentation for these containers can be found
