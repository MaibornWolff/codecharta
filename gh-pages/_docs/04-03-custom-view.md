> Deprecation Note: Custom Views have replaced the download button in Version 1.120.1. The functionality of downloading a .cc.json file including e.g. currently blacklisted items or marked packages has been replaced and extended by the Custom Views feature. Now, it is possible to save and download multiple Custom Views for a map with actually all current settings. They can be activated upon a loaded map to replay the stored settings by not changing the original cc.json file.
