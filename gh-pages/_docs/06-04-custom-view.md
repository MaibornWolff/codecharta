Custom Views allow you to save and upload your individual configurations for certain maps. To save new configurations there is a "shortcut-button". In order to be able to access more settings, there is another button next to the "shortcut-button" with the following functions:

-   **Upload Custom Views**: Provides the possibility to upload previously downloaded Custom Views.
-   **Download Custom View(s)**: If a Custom View has been created, this function offers the possibility to export the created Custom Views based on the assigned maps in order to share the configuration file.
-   **Add Custom View**: For adding Custom Views. After a Custom View is added, the configurations are saved in the browser. Then, you can reapply it to restore all the settings that are saved in the Custom View.
