> Deprecation Note: Custom Views will replace the download button in Q2 2023

Custom Views allow you to save and upload your individual display configurations for certain maps, instead of modifying
and downloading an entire .cc.json file. To save new configurations there is a
[quick add button]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _docs/06-02-user-controls.md %})
in the menu bar. In order to be able to access more settings, there is another button next to the "quick add button"
with the following functions:

-   **Upload Custom Views**: Provides the possibility to upload previously downloaded Custom Views.
-   **Download Custom View(s)**: If a Custom View has been created, this function offers the possibility to export the
    created Custom Views based on the assigned maps in order to share the configuration file.
-   **Add Custom View**: For adding Custom Views. After a Custom View is added, the configurations are saved in the
    browser. Then, you can reapply it to restore all the settings that are saved in the Custom View.

If you want more information about using the visualization take a look at the
[user controls]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _docs/06-02-user-controls.md %}).
