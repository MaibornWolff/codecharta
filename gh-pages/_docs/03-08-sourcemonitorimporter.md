## Supported Metrics

| Metric                            | Description                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `loc`                             | Total count of lines in the source code, including lines with whitespace, comments, and actual code.          |
| `rloc`                            | Count of lines that contain actual code, excluding lines that are only whitespace, comments, or tabulations.  |
| `classes`                         | The total number of distinct classes defined within the source code.                                          |
| `functions_per_class`             | Average number of functions (or methods) defined within each class.                                           |
| `average_statements_per_function` | The mean number of statements within each function across the entire codebase.                                |
| `max_function_mcc`                | The highest McCabe's cyclomatic complexity found in any single function.                                      |
| `max_block_depth`                 | The greatest level of nesting of control structures (like loops or conditionals) within any part of the code. |
| `average_block_depth`             | The average depth of nested control structures across the entire codebase.                                    |
| `average_function_mcc`            | The mean McCabe's cyclomatic complexity across all functions.                                                 |
| `sm_percent_branch_statements`    | The percentage of all statements that are branch statements (e.g., if, else, switch, case).                   |
| `sm_method_call_statements`       | The count of statements in the code that are method or function calls.                                        |
| `sm_percent_lines_with_comments`  | The percentage of the total lines of code that contain comments.                                              |

## Usage and Parameters

| Parameters                      | description                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FILE`                          | sourcemonitor csv files                                           |
| `-h, --help`                    | displays help                                                     |
| `-o, --outputFile=<outputFile>` | output File (or empty for stdout)                                 |
| `-nc, --not-compressed`         | uncompresses outputfile to json format, if format of File is gzip |

```
Usage: ccsh sourcemonitorimport [-h] [-nc] [-o=<outputFile>] FILE...
```

### CSV Import for SourceMonitor

If you have analyzed your projectBuilder with SourceMonitor and exported the metric data (for classes only) to a csv-file, you may call the command

```
    ccsh sourcemonitorimport [-nc] [-o=<outputFile>] FILE
```

If the output file is omitted it prints the visualisation data to stdout.
Otherwise, it will export to a .gz file.

> Note that the output file should end with .cc.json

Currently, SourceMonitorImporter does not support metrics for methods in csv files from SourceMonitor.

### Wrapper Script sourcemonImport.bat

If SourceMonitor v3.5 is installed in 'C:\Program Files (x86)\SourceMonitor' you may use the wrapper script sourcemonImport.bat to generate and import metrics from SourceMonitor in one step:

```
sourcemonImport.bat <projectBuilder name> <source code path> <language>
```

If SourceMonitor is installed in a different directory the script must be changed accordingly.

### General CSV Import

You may use the [CSVImporter]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _docs/03-07-csvimporter.md %}) to import general CSV files.

## Example

An explicit example with the [Open Office Code](https://github.com/apache/openoffice), can be found [here]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _posts/how-to/2019-06-14-generate_with_sourcemonitor.md %})
