  Find the hotspots in your codebase and make them tangible.

At <a href="https://www.maibornwolff.de/en/">**MaibornWolff**</a>, we love good code and want to contribute to the world to help everyone around us have a better codebase. But before you can change anything, you need to identify and talk about the problems in your codebase.

CodeCharta is our attempt to make code more **tangible**, so that you can **communicate** with your managers or colleagues about your codebase, analyse it and find **hotspots**.
